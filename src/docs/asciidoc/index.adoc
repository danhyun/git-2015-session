== What is Git?

Cross platform, distributed +
source control management system.

=== Brief Background
 
[.step]
* Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds
* https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitFaq#Why_the_.27Git.27_name.3F[Named after Linus Torvalds]
* Used to maintain the https://github.com/torvalds/linux[Linux Kernel]

=== Motivations for Git

[horizontal]
Performance:: _fast_, reliable file integrity
Simplicity:: no separate admin binaries
Flexibility:: supports multiple protocols, methods of contributions, etc.

[NOTE.speaker]
performance: +
line endings windows vs *nix +
* file corruption detection with checksums +
simplicity - svnadmin anyone? +
flexibility:: ssh, ftp, http, email patch, user config

=== Git in action

.As of 2015-03-03
image::github-linux-kernel.PNG[]

[NOTE.speaker]
505,761 commits +
408 releases +
4,723 contributors +

== Fundamental concepts

[.step]
* Objects
* References
* Distributed

=== Objects

* Every file is an object
* Every commit is an object
* These objects form a tree

[NOTE.speaker]
every file is a compressed binary object +
each commit points to its parent +
commit points to a set of objects +
commits/object tree forms history

=== References

* `HEAD` is a reference
* Branches are references
* Tags are references
* Remotes are references

[NOTE.speaker]
References point to objects

=== Distributed

* No central server or authority
* Most actions performed locally

[NOTE.speaker]
Concept of central authority is social +
Each user contains a complete working copy of the files under revision +
Full commit history/logs +
All branches +

== State

== Snapshots

== Tracking Changes

== Git commands

== git init
----
$ git init demo
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/vagrant/demo/.git/
----

=== `init`
[source,terminal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
include::git-outputs/git-tree-init[]
----
<1> Current branch reference
<2> Blob storage
<3> Reference locations

== git add
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
$ git add _<file or path>_
----

=== `add`
----
include::git-outputs/git-add[]
----

=== git objects
----
$ find .git/objects/ -type f
.git/objects/e6/9de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391
----

== git commit

=== `commit`

== git push

=== `push`

== Git config

* project
* user
* system

== Best practices

TIP: Use command line initially to get a feel for the rhythm/terminology

* Use commandline exclusively in the beginning
* Adhere to your team's work flow

== Two popular models

* Develop -> Staging -> Master
* Commit to master
