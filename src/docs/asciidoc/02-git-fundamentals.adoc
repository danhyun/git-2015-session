== Fundamental concepts

[.step]
* Objects
* References
* State
* Distributed Nature

==  Objects

* Every file is an object
* Every commit is an object
* These objects form a tree

[NOTE.speaker]
every file is a compressed binary object +
each commit points to its parent +
commit points to a set of objects +
commits/object tree forms history

=== Objects

== References

* `HEAD` is a reference
* Branches are references
* Tags are references
* Remotes are references

[NOTE.speaker]
References point to objects

== State

A given file can be in one of these four states:

* Untracked
* Tracked - not modified
* Tracked - staged for commit
* Committed

=== State

[NOTE.speaker]
Tracked - not modified and committed are the same but distinction helps in illustrating a flow 

== Distributed

* No central server or authority
* Most actions performed locally
* Eliminates issues (politics) around commit access

[NOTE.speaker]
Concept of central authority is social +
Each user contains a complete working copy of the files under revision +
Full commit history/logs +
All branches +

== Git vs CVS/SVN

|===
| Attribute | Git | CVS/SVN

| Tracking changes
>| Snapshot of all files
>| Per file

| History storage
>| Compressed binary objects with SHA1 checksum
>| Diff per file in .cvs/.svn directories

| Source of truth
>| Distributed
>| Centralized
